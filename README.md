# Sudoku-Game

This is a Sudoku Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although I already knew about HTML and CSS before this project, I was tasked with learning in-depth about a new language, so I chose JavaScript because along with being widely used, it helps understand how to build dynamic web pages. Inspired by this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4uRtTb8U-U) by Tech with Tim (originally in Python), this version recreates the gameplay entirely in the browser. 

Some key features in this game include: 
- Interactive 9x9 Sudoku grid
- Ability to click on cells to select and input numbers
- Input validation
- Option to reset
- Some level of dynamic UI

Thank you for checking out my project!
